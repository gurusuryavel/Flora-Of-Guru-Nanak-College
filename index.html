        <P>Guru Nanak College was established in 1971 to commemorate the 500th birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Devji – the founder of the Sikh religion, by the Guru Nanak Educational Society (GNES). (Late) Lt. Col. G.S. Gill was the founder President,
            (Late) Padmashree P. N. Dhawan was the General Secretary and (Late) Sardar Manohar Singh Sabherwal was the Treasurer. This yeoman service of a small community of Sikhs, who made Tamil Nadu their home, after they left Punjab following the partition
            is historic.</P>
